## About Hypatia

Hypatia, a computational toolkit for the investigation of population-specific isoforms from LR-scRNAseq data, featuring three modes of differential analyses:
1) Isoform usage, which identifies differential isoform usage shifts (DIUs).
2) Isoform diversity, which classifies genes according to isoform species heterogeneity and identifies discrepances (DIVs).
3) Isoform expression, which detects differentially expressed isoforms (DEIs).
